Need to figure out who has access to what features in OBIEE 11g?
Or maybe you want a list of the roles and privileges set for Catalog objects?
Need to know who can save a report here? Or who can create dashboards?

And that would be easy enough... if you have an Admin role... but just think for a second... a client of yours sends a copy of the webcat and you need to understand how Tom, Dick and Harry setup security privileges and permissions...

This tool will traverse the presentation catalogue (11g) and produce a security audit report.
